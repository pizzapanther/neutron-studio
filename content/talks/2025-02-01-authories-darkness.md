## Become Creatively Subversive

"One of the problems with Christianity is that it has become respectable instead of radical" *Fr Dwight Longnecker*

"But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;" *1 Peter 2:9*

## Materialism and Atheism

- proposal that this physical world is all there is
- everything, including reason, is a product of the material world
- end point of materialism must be atheism - yet most people aren't Atheist

## Giving and Prayer+ vs Materialism and Atheism

- Our money and our time are manifestations of the this world. When we give them to God we declare who our real master is by our actions

---

## Giving and Prayer+

No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. *Matthew 6:24 NIV*

For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. *1 Tim 6:10 NKJV*

---

## Giving and Prayer+

But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. *Matthew 6:33 NKJV*

Be cheerful no matter what; pray all the time; thank God no matter what happens. This is the way God wants you who belong to Christ Jesus to live. *1 Thessalonians 5:16-18*
