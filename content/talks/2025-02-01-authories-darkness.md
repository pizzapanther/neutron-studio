No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money. *Matthew 6:24 NIV*

For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. *1 Tim 6:10 NKJV*

## Giving and Prayer+

But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. *Matthew 6:33 NKJV*

Be cheerful no matter what; pray all the time; thank God no matter what happens. This is the way God wants you who belong to Christ Jesus to live. *1 Thessalonians 5:16-18*

Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. *2 Timothy 2:15*

## Spiritual Gifts

But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills. *1 Corinthians 12:7-11 NKJV*

Therefore, brethren, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or our epistle. *2 Thessalonians 2:15*

Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ. Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things and keep the traditions just as I delivered them to you. *1 Corinthians 11:1-2*

idea that initiatives should be taken and solutions should be implemented at the lowest local level possible

## Subsidiarity

If anyone is poor among your fellow Israelites in any of the towns of the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward them. 8 Rather, be openhanded and freely lend them whatever they need. *Deuteronomy 15:7-8*

If any believing man or woman has widows, let them relieve them, and do not let the church be burdened, that it may relieve those who are really widows. *1 Timothy 5:16 NKJV*
